    "Clustering is a machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their intrinsic patterns or similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify natural groupings or clusters within a dataset without any prior knowledge of class labels or categories. Clustering algorithms aim to partition the data into clusters where the data points within each cluster are similar to each other, while data points from different clusters are dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some commonly used clustering algorithms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. K-means: K-means clustering partitions the data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and the centroid of each cluster. It aims to find K cluster centroids that minimize the within-cluster variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchical structure of clusters, either in a top-down (divisive) or bottom-up (agglomerative) manner. It creates a cluster tree (dendrogram) where the branching indicates the similarity or dissimilarity between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN groups together data points based on density connectivity. It defines clusters as areas of high-density separated by areas of low-density and can handle arbitrary-shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): GMM represents each cluster as a Gaussian distribution. It assumes that the data points are generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and estimates the parameters of these distributions to determine cluster assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Mean Shift: Mean Shift clustering involves iteratively shifting the cluster centers to regions of higher density in the data space. It aims to find the local maxima of the data density and assigns data points to the nearest cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clustering algorithms offer different approaches to grouping data points based on their characteristics, density, or distance measures. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the data, desired cluster structure, and specific requirements of the problem at hand."

    "1. Initialization: Assign labels to the labeled data points based on the provided information or prior knowledge. Unlabeled data points are left without labels initially.\n",

Various similarity metrics can be used, such as distance measures, graph-based approaches, or kernel functions.

    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection: Anomaly detection aims to identify data points or instances that significantly differ from the majority of the data. It focuses on detecting rare, abnormal, or anomalous patterns in the dataset. Anomalies can be outliers or instances that exhibit unusual behavior compared to the majority of the data points. Anomaly detection models are typically trained on a dataset containing normal instances and aim to identify instances that do not conform to the expected patterns.\n",

    "Novelty Detection: Novelty detection, on the other hand, focuses on identifying novel or new patterns or instances that differ from the known data. It aims to identify instances that the model has not encountered during training. Novelty detection is concerned with detecting instances that are different from the training data distribution and have not been seen before. It is often used in scenarios where new or previously unseen data needs to be flagged or evaluated.\n",

    "In summary, the main difference lies in the focus of detection. Anomaly detection seeks to identify instances that deviate from the majority of the data, whereas novelty detection aims to identify instances that are different from the training data and have not been encountered before. Anomaly detection deals with detecting abnormalities within the known data distribution, while novelty detection deals with detecting instances outside the known data distribution."

The EM algorithm alternates between the expectation step (E-step) and the maximization step (M-step) to update the parameters and improve the fit of the model to the data.\n",
