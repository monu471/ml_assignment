    "In the context of robotics, RL allows the robot to learn through interaction with its environment. The robot takes actions, receives feedback or rewards based on the outcomes of those actions, and learns to optimize its behavior over time to maximize the cumulative rewards. RL algorithms employ trial-and-error exploration and exploitation to learn effective policies or strategies for navigating and adapting to different terrains.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using RL, the robot can learn how to balance, adjust its movements, and adapt its gait to various types of terrains, such as grass, sand, or rocky surfaces. The model learns from its own experiences, continually refining its walking technique based on the feedback it receives from the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "RL models can incorporate techniques such as value functions, policy gradients, or deep reinforcement learning to handle the complexity of robotic locomotion. The model can leverage sensor inputs, such as cameras or depth sensors, to perceive the terrain and make informed decisions on how to traverse it.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Information Leakage: When the test set is used for hyperparameter tuning, knowledge about the test set is implicitly incorporated into the model selection process. This can lead to overfitting to the test set, where the model's hyperparameters are optimized specifically for that particular set of data, causing it to perform poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "2. Lack of Generalization: The primary purpose of a test set is to assess a model's generalization ability on unseen data. If the test set is used for hyperparameter tuning, it no longer serves as an independent measure of the model's performance. Consequently, the model's performance estimates on new data may be overly optimistic and not reflective of its true performance in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limited Evaluation Capacity: The test set has a limited amount of data available for evaluation. If the test set is used for hyperparameter tuning, the available data for final model evaluation decreases, reducing the reliability of the performance estimates. This can make it difficult to assess the model's performance robustly or to make accurate comparisons between different models or hyperparameter settings.\n",

    "To address these issues, it is recommended to split the available data into three sets: the training set, the validation set, and the test set. The validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, allowing for unbiased evaluation and selection of the best-performing model. The final model's performance is then assessed on the independent test set, providing a fair evaluation of its generalization ability.\n",
